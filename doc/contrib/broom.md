# Broom: Moebius multiprocessing offloading engine

## Purpose

Broom allows to switch from single-threaded processing model to worker-like processing model. It could give You two benefits:

1. Utilize all CPU cores on heavy services.
2. Implement slow query processing (for example slow database response) without additional asynchronous code.
3. 

## Status

It's alfa.
